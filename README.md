# Github Practice Activity - Data Privacy Toolkit

## Overview
This repository contains a guide on implementing data privacy standards within social movements and organizations. It was created to serve as a starter kit for organizations looking to bring similar standards to their work. These organizations can use the Data Privacy Guide as a starting point to start building their own policies. The group maintaining this repository is regularly adding new tools and content for these organizations to use.

## Fork Activity

**Step 1. Create a fork of the Generation-Data/github-practice repository.**

At the top of this page, click the "Fork" button to start creating a fork of the repo.

On the "Create a new fork" page, take note of the following settings:

Click the "Create fork" button.

#### Examining Our New Fork

Take a look at the fork you just created. Notice that the repository is now `[your-github-id]/github-practice` instead of `Generation-Data/github-practice`.

**Step 2: Start a new codespace on the main branch of your forked repo.**

> Discussion: Take a look at the files in the repo. What kinds of files/folders are present and what are their purposes?

Open the data privacy guide at `guide/data-privacy.md`. Open the markdown preview window if it doesn't open automatically


Ensure that you're on the main branch by running:
```
git branch
```

Within your repo, you not only have access to the forked copy of the code you made, but also the code in the original repo as well. The site where a repo is hosted online is called a `remote`, and we pull and push new code to that new remote from our `local` code repo.

You can view the list of remotes for a given repo by running:
```
git remote
```

You can also add the `-v` flag to display a little more information about the remotes:
```
git remote -v
```

## Branch Activity

When using source control in software development, it is standard practice to keep your `main` branch as the most stable version of your code. If you want to test out some major changes that might make your code unstable, creating a branch is a great option for making a copy of your code and isolating those experimental changes fromt he rest of the repo.

**Step 1. Open the Data Privacy Guide at `guide/data-privacy.md`**.

Scroll down to the *Implementing Data Privacy Standards* section towards the end of the guide.

> As you can see, the example data privacy policy section is formatted as a code snippet. We want to change this formatting to a **block quote**, like this section, in order to render the heading sizes.

**Step 2. Create a branch named `feature-update-guide` in your forked repo.**

You can create a new branch in your repo on your codespace by running the command:
```
git checkout -b feature-update-guide
```

Run `git branch` to ensure that you've switched to your newly created branch:

**Step 3. In the `data-privacy.md` file, change the data privacy policy snippet to a block quote.**

Remove the markdown-formatted block and add a `>` symbol next to each line in the section. Your markdown file should look like this:

```markdown
### Example Data Privacy Policy (Snippet)


> ### Data Privacy Policy
> 
> #### Data Collection and Usage
>
> We collect personal data (e.g., names, email addresses) only with explicit consent and for specified purposes. Data is used solely for internal communication and organizing purposes.
>
> #### Data Security
> 
> All personal data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption methods. Access is restricted to authorized > personnel only.
> 
> #### Data Retention
> 
> We retain personal data only as long as necessary for organizational purposes or as required by law. Data will be securely deleted when no longer needed.
> 
> #### Consent and Rights
> 
> Individuals have the right to access, correct, or delete their personal data upon request. Consent can be withdrawn at any time.
```

Verify your changes in the preview window.

**Step 4. Add and commit your changes to the feature branch.**

Check status of changes on your branch:
```
git status
```

Stage the changes you made to `data-privacy.md` (multiple options):
```
git add .
```

**or**

```
git add guide/data-privacy.md
```

**or**

```
git add -u
```

**Step 5. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.**

```
git commit -m "Reformat data privacy example"
```

**Step 6. Push your commit on your new branch to your forked repo**

```
git push
```

You should get an error message like the one below:

```bash
@kellyhopkins âžœ /workspaces/github-practice (feature-update-guide) $ git push
fatal: The current branch feature-update-guide has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin feature-update-guide

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
```

Publish your new branch by following the directions the the error message or pressing the "Publish Branch" button in the Source Control menu and selecting `origin` as the remote.

Verify your new branch in Github.


## Merge Activity

**Step 1. Merge your changes on your feature branch into your main branch.**

Switch back to your main branch:
```
git checkout main
```

Merge the feature branch into the main branch:
```
git merge feature-update-guide
```

Push your changes to the mian branch on `origin`:
```
git push
```
